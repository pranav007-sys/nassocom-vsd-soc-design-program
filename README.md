# ðŸ§ª Lab Progress â€“ NASSCOM-VSD SoC Design Program

Welcome to the lab progress documentation for the NASSCOM-VSD SoC Design Program. This repository captures each step of the RTL-to-GDS flow using the SkyWater SKY130 open-source PDK and a full suite of open-source EDA tools.

"This program takes learners through the full custom ASIC design flow â€” from RTL design, synthesis, floorplanning, clock tree synthesis, and routing to physical verification and GDSII generation."

---

## Project Overview

This repository showcases a series of lab sessions that introduce and reinforce the concepts of:

- ASIC flow using open-source tools like OpenLANE, Magic, ngspice, and OpenSTA  
- Digital and analog design concepts  
- Timing closure and physical verification  
- Real-world design techniques using the SKY130 PDK

These labs simulate the full industrial RTL2GDS process â€” using completely open-source tooling.
